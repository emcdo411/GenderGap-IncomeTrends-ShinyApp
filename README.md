# 💸 Digital Wage Gap Explorer

**Repository Name Suggestion:** `GenderGap-IncomeTrends-ShinyApp`

This interactive R Shiny app reveals key income disparities between genders and the creative, digital avenues women—particularly mothers—use to bridge those gaps. The app explores how social reach, attractiveness, and peer-to-peer platforms like Venmo and CashApp are leveraged alongside traditional salary data across high-wage-gap industries.

## ✅ Summary

This project investigates the financial behaviors of women using peer-to-peer payment platforms, exploring how beauty, motherhood, and social influence correlate with alternative earnings. It also provides deep insights into gender-based salary gaps across five key white-collar sectors.

---

## ❗ Why This Matters

Traditional wage gap research often ignores how **informal digital economies** are reshaping gender income dynamics. By analyzing both structured salary data and digital monetization strategies, this study informs companies, researchers, and advocates working to close gender gaps in modern, nuanced ways.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📉 **Women still earn ~$8K less** on average.
- 🧒 **Mothers earn even less**, showing the cost of caregiving.
- 💄 **Attractive women** are tipped more via P2P platforms.
- 📱 **More followers = more tips** — social capital monetized.
- 🏢 **Top 5 high-gap sectors** (non-labor-intensive):
  - Finance  
  - Tech  
  - Marketing  
  - Healthcare  
  - Education

## 🧪 Data Sources and Methodology

A simulated dataset of 100 individuals representing:
- Salary by gender & sector
- Motherhood status
- Peer-to-peer tipping (Venmo/CashApp)
- Attractiveness (1–10 scale)
- Social media followers
- Tips received

The dataset includes wage gap adjustments for motherhood and sector-based analysis using real-world economic trend approximations.

## 📈 Visualizations

1. **Gender vs. Salary**  
2. **Gender vs. Tips**  
3. **Motherhood vs. Salary**  
4. **Attractiveness vs. Tips**  
5. **Followers vs. Tips**  
6. **Wage Gap by Sector**

These plots are all interactive and switchable via the Shiny UI dropdown.

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

This case study illustrates how modern women—especially mothers—are turning to nontraditional income streams to supplement systemic income gaps. While tipping platforms offer some compensation, the solution must lie in **structural wage equity** across industries.
